### **A2 - Impact on the regularity of the task’s jobs and correlation with the priority**

For this exercise, whe created 3 tasks, A, B and C, with 1, 50 and 99 of priority, respectively.
In our 4 core VM, we ran 4 instances of A2 simultaneously to strain the system, and what we could observe is that task C appears to finish almost always first, in all instances, and thus proving to be more regular. This can be explain by it having a **higher priority in a preemptive system**, which means it is always put **first in queue for execution** while other may be pushed back.
