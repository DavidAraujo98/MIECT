## Tasks

For this tutorial, three main task needed to be configured in the program:
 - a **control for the LEDs**,
 - a set of **three tasks** using threads, shared memory and semaphores;
 - a controller to **receive the signal** line from the potentiometer.

## Functionalities

The control of the **blinking LEDs** is done by the *main* method, where the LEDs will all blink when the global variable *blink* is **1 or greater**, set by pressing the **button 1**.

For the tasks of **sampling the signal**, **calculating the moving average** and **outputting** the values to the console and LEDs, it was created:
 - **3** threads: *sampler*, *filter*, *output*;
 - **2** semaphores: *ab* and *bc*;
 - **3** shared variables: *new_sample*, *filtered*, *blink*.

### Sequence of events

1. For sampling, the ADC is read by the *sampler* task, which stores this value in the *new_sample* buffer and *give* the semaphore *sem_ab*. It will then sleep for a designated sleeping period, after which will **repeat the process**.
2. The task *filter*, after creation, will **wait for *sem_ab*** to activate. This task's method contains an array that, in a circular fashion,** stores the last 10 values passed** in the *new_sample* buffer. After each calculation of a moving average, the task *filter* will store this calculated value in *filtered* and then **give the semaphore *sem_bc***.
4. The *output* task, after creation, **will wait for *sem_bc*** to activate. When the semaphore is taken, this task's method will **check the variable *blink*** which will be **different** than **0** if the blinking process is taking place, and if it is not, it will then set the LEDs for the corresponding states according to the value of *filtered*.
